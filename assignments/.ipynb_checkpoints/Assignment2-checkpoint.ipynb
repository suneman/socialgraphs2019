    "_Exercise_ 1: Build the network of retweets.\n",
    "We will now build a network that has as nodes the Twitter handles of the members of the house, and direct edges between nodes A and B if A has retweeted content posted by B. We will build a weighted network, where the weight of an edge is equal to the number of retweets. You can build the network following the steps below (and you should  be able to reuse many of the functions you wrote in previous weeks):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consider the 200 most recent tweets written by each member of the house (use the files [here](https://github.com/suneman/socialgraphs2018/tree/master/files/data_twitter/tweets/), or the ones you produced in Part 1). For each file, use a regular expression to find retweets and to extract the Twitter handle of the user whose content was retweeted. All retweets begin with \"_RT @originalAuthor:_\", where \"_originalAuthor_\" is the handle of the user whose content was retweeted (and the part of the text you want to extract).\n",
    "* For each retweet, check if the handle retweeted is the one of a member of the house. If yes, keep it. If no, discard it.\n",
    "* Use a NetworkX [`DiGraph`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/development/reference/classes.digraph.html) to store the network. Use weighted edges to account for multiple retweets. Store also the party of each member as a node attribute (use the data in [this file](https://github.com/suneman/socialgraphs2018/blob/master/files/data_twitter/H115_tw.csv), or the data you downloaded in Part 1). Remove self-loops (edges that connect a node with itself).\n"
